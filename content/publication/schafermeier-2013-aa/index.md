abstract: In this paper, we describe our PhD research on an aspect-oriented approach
  for multi-dimensional specification of ontology modules driven by cross-cutting
  modularization requirements. The problem with existing modularization techniques
  lies in their respective focus on a single dimension along which a problem space
  can be segmented. We believe, however, that the majority of real-world ontology
  development scenarios is more complex, and that most applications have the potential
  for providing multiple cross-cutting modularization use cases. We examine commonalities
  between ontology modules and software aspects and propose an approach to applying
  the latter to the problem of a priori construction of modular ontologies and a posteriori
  ontology modularization.
