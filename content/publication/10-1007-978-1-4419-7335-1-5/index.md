abstract: The amount of information that companies have to produce, acquire, maintain,
  propagate, and use has increased dramatically over the last decades. Nowadays, companies
  seek more capable approaches for gaining, managing, and utilizing knowledge, and
  the Semantic Web offers promising solutions. While the global Semantic Web still
  remains an unfulfilled vision for the present, the Corporate Semantic Web idea aims
  at bringing semantic technologies to enterprises. The expected results are a competitive
  advantage for enterprises using semantic technologies and a boost for the evolution
  of the global Semantic Web.
