It's been a weird one and a half years. My travel plans have ground to a halt due to the pandemic and family matters. Thank God I was in New Zealand (twice in a row) just before COVID-19 happenend, which somewhat filled up the reserve tanks. But after over a year of working from home and barely leaving the city the tanks have run bone dry and I was more than ever desperate to break out of the daily routine. So I pulled out the good old bucket list and scanned it for unchecked items that are achievable within the time frame of a summer and under the given circumstances. And the choice fell on becoming a licensed skydiver.

It was a crazy and fantastic journey. Skydivers are a wonderful bunch of people. My instructors and the staff at the [drop zone](https://www.gojump.de/home/) were awesome and managed to teach me how to have fun while plummeting towards our big fat home planet at 200km/h (about 125 mph) and how to stay safe while doing it. The nervousness during the ride to altitude (we jump from 4000m/13,000ft out of a lovely [Cessna 208 Caravan](https://www.openspotter.org/bild.php?blid=69633)) transforms into pure bliss the very moment you throw yourself out of that aircraft door.

With only 30 jumps under my belt I am a complete noob and my journey has just begun. I would not even call myself a skydiver yet. I have just learned to jump out of a plane on my own, stay stable in free fall, open the parachute and land in one piece (plus the very basics of formation flying). There is still A LOT to learn, and that's a good thing and something I look forward to. I can't wait to go back next year, continue my progression and, most importantly, see my fellow students and the crowd at the drop zone and jump out of that plane again. ü§ô
